First, you need to download and install these:

Node.js / npm

https://nodejs.org/en/download

Truffle

https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/how-to/install/

Ganache

https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/

Also, do not forget to add MetaMask Extension to your browser.

Install these additional packages just in case to avoid errors:

Web3.js: npm i web3

Solidity (solc-js): npm i solc

Steps to implement the project:

Step 1:

Clone the GitHub repository “git clone https://github.com/shifaj22/E-Voting_System_Blockchain “

Step 2:

Connecting MetaMask and Ganache

In MetaMask, go to settings > networks > add network. You can also get to this by clicking the MetaMask extension pinned on your browser > clicking the profile picture > settings > networks > add network.
Name the network Ganache.
For the New RPC URL go to ganache where you’ll copy the RPC server URL and paste it into Metamask.
The chain ID for the ganache is 1337.
You can name the currency symbol “ETH” and save.
Step 3:

Check the truffle-config.js file. The port number should be 7545 as we are not using the ganache-cli.

Step 4:

cd E-Voting_System_Blockchain

npm i

truffle migrate — reset
